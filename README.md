Course link can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)

## This repo contains...
* Official **jupyter notebook** for each week
* My **Learning note** for each week including **homework solution**

## Attention
If you are taking this course now, please note this repo do not contain any data used in notebooks here. 

Everyone who want to run the notebooks here should register the course(link provided above) to get the data (fortunately the course is **free** if you do not have a strong willing to get the certificate). By the way, since this course use an commercial lib named GraphLab Create, you need to navigate to [THE OFFICIAL SITE](https://turi.com/) to apply license(GraphLab Create is free for academic purposes indefinitely) for academic purpose.

Last but not least, **do not copy paste** the code from my solution directly, you will learn more by trying your best to finish all the homeworks.
