## Attention
If you are taking this course now, please note this repo do not contain any data used in notebooks here. 

Everyone who want to run the notebooks here should register the course(link provided above) to get the data (fortunately the course is **free** if you do not need to get the certificate).

Last but not least, **do not copy paste** the code from my solution directly, you will learn more by trying your best to finish all the homeworks.
